If you’ve ever clicked **Unsubscribe** in Gmail and **kept** getting emails, you’re not crazy. Here’s the no-nonsense guide that actually works in 2025.

## The safest order of operations

1) **Gmail's built-in Unsubscribe** (when shown). It uses **List-Unsubscribe** headers, which is safer than random links.  
2) **Gmail's Manage subscriptions** view for a quick batch of known newsletters.  
3) **MailMop for the stubborn stuff** (and for deleting the back-catalog in one sweep).

## Why unsubscribing often fails

- **Broken/slow headers:** Many senders attach a **List-Unsubscribe** that points to a dead link or a non-automated email address. Your "unsubscribe" goes to a black hole.  
- **Malicious links:** Shady emails use fake unsubscribe pages to confirm your address or phish. When in doubt, **don't click**—**block/report spam** instead.

## Step-by-step (Gmail)

1) **Open a newsletter** → if Gmail shows **Unsubscribe** next to the sender, click it and confirm.  
2) Visit **Manage subscriptions** to scan frequent senders and unsubscribe in one place (web + mobile rollout).  
3) **Search & delete** history: after unsubscribing, search `from:sender@domain.com` and delete old emails. **Empty Trash** to free space.

## When to use **Block** instead of **Unsubscribe**

If you never opted in, or the email looks sketchy (typos, odd "from" domains, HTTP links), **Block** or **Report spam**. Gmail intentionally avoids showing an Unsubscribe button on obvious spam.

## What MailMop changes

Most tools (and Gmail) rely only on the **List-Unsubscribe** header. **MailMop goes further**:

- **Body-level unsubscribe parsing**: we scan the email body to find the real, human-visible unsubscribe URL when headers are bogus—so the unsubscribe actually takes.  
- **Local-only privacy**: your email data **never leaves your computer**.  
- **Bulk cleanup**: **Delete with Exceptions** (keep receipts, remove promos), **Block Sender**, **Mark Read/Unread**, **Add/Remove Label**, **CSV Export**.

### Fast recipe (works every time)

1) Use Gmail's Unsubscribe + Manage subscriptions for the low-hanging fruit.  
2) Run MailMop to **finish**: real-unsubscribe the stubborns, **delete** their history with exceptions, **block** repeat offenders.  
3) Repeat monthly; it takes 10 minutes.

You’ll notice the quiet immediately.
