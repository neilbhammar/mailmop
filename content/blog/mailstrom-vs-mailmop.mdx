Mailstrom’s been around for ages. It’s powerful for grouping and sorting—but its unsubscribe flow shows its age. Let’s compare it to MailMop in 2025.

## What Mailstrom still does well

- Big-inbox **grouping/triage** (sender, subject, time).  
- Familiar UI.  
- Around **$59.95/year** according to recent G2 reviews.

## Where Mailstrom struggles

- **Unsubscribes one sender at a time.** For long lists, that's hours of clicking.  
- If no **List-Unsubscribe** address exists, Mailstrom **opens the sender's website** and makes you finish the process manually—putting the work back on you.

## What MailMop changes

- **Real-unsubscribe that sticks:** Headers **and** the **body**. If a sender wires headers to dead endpoints (common), MailMop surfaces the human-visible URL so you're **actually** removed.  
- **Bulk deletion that respects edge cases:** **Delete with Exceptions** (e.g., keep receipts, kill promos).  
- **Block Sender** for repeat offenders, plus **Mark Read/Unread**, **Add/Remove Label**, **Create Filters**, and **CSV Export**.  
- **Local-only privacy:** Everything runs on **your computer**, not ours.

## Practical advice

- Love manual triage? Mailstrom's grouping helps—just budget time for unsubscribes.  
- Want the fastest end-to-end fix with real unsubscribes and safe bulk deletes? Use MailMop.

Progress beats nostalgia when you have 50k unread.
