**Short answer:** Gmail's new **Manage subscriptions** is perfect for light gardening. For actual yard work—removing stubborn senders, deleting years of backlog (with exceptions), and keeping your data local—MailMop still earns its spot.

## Where Gmail shines

- **Centralized list** of frequent newsletter senders with **one-click Unsubscribe**, rolling out on web and mobile.  
- **Native convenience:** no new app, low friction.  
- **Safer than random links:** Uses structured List-Unsubscribe headers instead of sending you to unknown pages.

## Why people still get emails after clicking Unsubscribe

Two common reasons:

1) **Fake or slow endpoints.** Many senders wire the **List-Unsubscribe** header to a non-automated email address or a dead link. Your request goes nowhere, so emails keep coming.  
2) **Shady actors.** With spammy senders, clicking "unsubscribe" can **confirm your address** and lead to more spam or phishing. Block/report instead.

## What MailMop adds (that you’ll feel immediately)

- **Real-unsubscribe that sticks.** MailMop doesn’t stop at headers; it **parses the email body** to surface the true, sender-hosted unsubscribe page—the one humans see—so you actually get removed.  
- **Local-only privacy.** All analysis and actions run **on your machine**. We don’t ingest or store your email data.  
- **Backlog cleanup in minutes:**  
  - **Delete with Exceptions** (e.g., nuke promos but keep receipts)  
  - **Block Sender** when unsub fails or the sender looks sketchy  
  - **Mark Read/Unread**, **Add/Remove Label**, and **Create Filters** for prevention  
  - **CSV Export** of senders & counts for your records

## Feature comparison

| Task | Gmail Manage Subscriptions | MailMop |
|---|---|---|
| One-click unsubscribe | ✅ For recognized senders | ✅ + **Body-level** parsing when headers are broken |
| Bulk delete old mail | ❌ Manual search & delete | ✅ **Delete with Exceptions** and prompts to empty Trash |
| Handle shady senders | 🚫 Use Report spam/Block separately | ✅ **Block Sender** in bulk alongside unsubscribes |
| Privacy posture | Google-hosted | **Local-only**, no server storage |
| Reporting | Basic counts in UI | **CSV Export**, sender frequency, action logs |

## Practical flow we recommend

1) Do a quick sweep in **Manage subscriptions** for the obvious newsletters.  
2) Open MailMop to **finish the job**: real-unsubscribe + bulk delete historical messages (keep the good stuff with **Exceptions**) and block repeat offenders.

Gmail gave you the scissors. MailMop brings the hedge trimmer—without your data ever leaving your computer.
