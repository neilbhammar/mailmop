# MailMop 📧🧹

> As of June 2025: Currently beta-testing with a few folks prior to submitting for Google's CASA 2 verification.

**A privacy-first Gmail inbox decluttering tool that processes everything locally in your browser**

MailMop is a client-heavy, privacy-focused Gmail cleaning tool built with Next.js, Supabase, and the Gmail API. Unlike traditional email management tools that upload your data to remote servers, MailMop processes everything locally in your browser, ensuring your emails never leave your device.

## 📖 Background & Why I Built This

### The Problem
I was drowning in my Gmail inbox with over 50,000 emails. Most existing inbox cleaning tools require you to upload your emails to their servers, which felt uncomfortable from a privacy standpoint. I wanted something that:

- **Respects privacy**: Processes emails locally, never uploads them
- **Actually works**: Can handle massive inboxes (50k-500k+ emails)  
- **Is transparent**: Open source so you can see exactly what it does
- **Focuses on metadata**: Only looks at headers (sender, subject, date), analyzes body content upon use of the unsubscribe feature to extract functional unsubscribe links.

### The Solution
I built MailMop to be the email cleaning tool I wanted to exist. It uses the Gmail API's metadata-only scope to analyze your inbox locally, identifying bulk senders, promotions, and noise—all while keeping your emails on your device.

### A Note on Experience

**Full transparency**: I'm not a professional developer, in fact, I'm not even technical! I've always had an appreciation for the engineers I've worked with and a fascination for making things, so this was my way of dipping my toes in the water. This is my first time building something substantial and (despite 95% of the code surely being Cursor generated) I tried to be really intentional about architecture and quality. That said, I'm certain I made a lot of suboptimal decisions and trade-offs along the way.

If you're an experienced developer and see things that could be improved, I'd genuinely love your feedback! The goal was to build something that works well and is maintainable, but I know there's going to be tons of room for improvement.

## 🔐 Privacy-First Architecture

### Why Local Processing Matters

Traditional email tools work like this:
```
Your Gmail → Their Servers → Analysis → Results
```

MailMop works like this:
```
Your Gmail → Your Browser → Analysis → Results
```

**Key Privacy Features:**
- ✅ **Client-side processing**: All analysis happens in your browser
- ✅ **Metadata based**: We primarily access email headers, we request full access so that MailMop can do advanced queries when fetching and enrich unsubscribe links via body content.
- ✅ **No email storage**: Your emails are never uploaded or stored
- ✅ **Revoke anytime**: Disconnect with one click

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, Edge Functions)
- **Gmail Integration**: Gmail API
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB for efficient local data caching
- **State Management**: React Context with custom providers
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + ShadCN for accessible components
- **AI Development Stack**: [Cursor](https://cursor.so/) with Claude Sonnet for AI-assisted development

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Client-Heavy Design**
- Gmail API calls made directly from browser using gapi
- Refresh tokens stored in secure httpOnly cookies
- Access tokens cached in memory only (never persisted)
- Heavy metadata processing done locally with IndexedDB

**2. Progressive Analysis**
- Analyzes inboxes in batches (100 messages at a time)
- Real-time updates as analysis progresses
- Can handle massive inboxes (tested with 500k+ emails)

**3. Context-Driven State**
- `AuthProvider`: User authentication state
- `GmailPermissionsProvider`: Gmail API access management  
- `AnalysisProvider`: Inbox analysis state and operations

**4. Privacy by Design**
- No email content ever processed
- Minimal server-side data (just user auth and action logs)
- All sensitive operations happen client-side

## 🌟 Why Open Source?

I'm making MailMop **source available** for several reasons:

1. **Transparency**: Email tools should be transparent about what they do with your data
2. **Trust**: You can audit the code to verify privacy claims
3. **Learning**: This is my first major project—I'd love feedback from experienced developers
4. **Community**: Others might want to contribute improvements or fork for their needs

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to be sure you're on the right node version!)
- npm or yarn
- A Google Cloud Project (for Gmail API)
- A Supabase account

### 1. Clone the Repository, Activate Correct Node Version, & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neilbhammar/mailmop.git
cd mailmop
nvm use
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Search Gmail API in the searchbar at the top, and enable it
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - You will be using User Data, not Application Data
   - Application type: Web application
   - Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

### 2.5. Configure Gmail API Scopes

MailMop requires specific Gmail API scopes to function properly. You need to configure these scopes in your Google Cloud Console:

1. **Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen** in your Google Cloud Console
2. **Add the following scopes** to your OAuth consent configuration:

#### Required Scopes:

**Non-sensitive scopes:**
- `../auth/userinfo.profile`
  - **Purpose**: See your personal info, including any personal info you've made publicly available
  - **Why needed**: To display your name and profile picture in the app interface

- `../auth/gmail.labels`
  - **Purpose**: See and edit your email labels
  - **Why needed**: To view create labels

**Restricted scopes (Gmail scopes):**
- `../auth/gmail.settings.basic`
  - **Purpose**: See, edit, create or change your email settings and filters in Gmail
  - **Why needed** To block senders, auto apply labels in the future

- `https://mail.google.com/`
  - **Purpose**: Read, compose, send and permanently delete all your email from Gmail
  - **Why needed**: To analyze email metadata (sender, subject, date) with query parameters and perform bulk actions like deleting emails.

#### Important: Test Users for Restricted Scopes

Since MailMop uses **restricted scopes** (which request access to sensitive Gmail data), your OAuth app will be in "testing" mode unless it goes through Google's verification process. Instead you can:

1. **Add yourself as a test user**:
   - In Google Cloud Console, go to **OAuth consent screen**
   - Scroll down to **Test users**
   - Click **Add Users** and add your Gmail address
   - Save the changes

2. **Test users can use the app immediately** without waiting for Google's app verification
3. **Non-test users will see a warning screen** will not be able to use the app/connect their Gmail.

### 3. Set Up Supabase & Connect Supabase with Google OAuth

1. [Create a new Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Get YOUR_PROJECT_REF, which is the first part of the Project URL, e.g.: `https://{YOUR_PROJECT_REF}.supabase.co`
3. Run the database migrations:
   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   npx supabase db push
   ```
4. Set up authentication in Supabase:
   - Go to Authentication → Providers → Google
   - Add your Google OAuth credentials
   - Copy the Callback URL (for OAuth)
5. Now, back in your Google project, search Auth. In the Google Auth Platform, select your Web client, and scroll down to Authorized Redirect URIs. Add the Callback URL (for OAuth) from Supabase and Save.

### 4. Environment Variables

Copy `env.example` to a `.env.local` file in the project root, and drop in these values:

```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key"

# Google OAuth (for local development)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"

# Local URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

The rest are optional. You can get NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from your Project Settings under API Keys. The Google values are the same you saved in step 2.4.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## 📊 Database Schema

The project uses Supabase with the following key tables:

- `profiles`: User profile information
- `action_logs`: Analytics on user actions (delete, unsubscribe, etc.)
- `daily_stats`: Aggregated statistics for the landing page
- `beta_whitelist`: Beta access management

All migrations are in `supabase/migrations/` and version controlled.

## 🔧 Key Features

- **📊 Inbox Analysis**: Identify bulk senders and email patterns
- **🗑️ Bulk Actions**: Delete, unsubscribe, mark as read in batches
- **🏷️ Smart Labels**: Automatic labeling and Gmail filter creation
- **📱 Progressive Analysis**: Works with any inbox size
- **🔄 Real-time Updates**: See results as analysis progresses
- **🎯 Sender Insights**: Detailed breakdown by sender with action counts
- **📈 Statistics**: Track your inbox cleaning progress

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is designed to be deployed on Vercel with Supabase as the backend:

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Set production environment variables
3. Configure Supabase Edge Functions
4. Update Google OAuth redirect URIs for production
