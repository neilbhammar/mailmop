# Unsubscribe Enrichment Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Overview

**Goal**: Improve unsubscribe success rates from ~10% to ~80%+ by extracting fresh unsubscribe links from email bodies instead of relying solely on stale List-Unsubscribe headers.

**Problem**: 90% of List-Unsubscribe header URLs are stale/broken, but email bodies typically contain current, working unsubscribe links.

**Solution**: **Append-only enrichment** that extracts working links from email bodies and stores them separately from header data, with zero impact on analysis performance.

## 🏗️ Technical Approach

### Architecture Decision: Dedicated Web Worker
- **Dedicated web worker** for enrichment processing
- Main thread handles analysis, UI, and data storage
- Reasons:
  - **No browser throttling**: Background tabs throttle timers to ~1Hz, killing performance
  - **True parallelism**: Enrichment runs independently of analysis
  - **Better UX**: Works at full speed even when user switches tabs
  - **Scalable**: Can handle heavy processing without blocking UI

### Core Flow
1. **Initial Discovery**: Detect new senders with List-Unsubscribe headers,
2. **Conservative Batch Enrichment**: Process backlog of senders at ~10 API calls/sec (120/minute) to respect quota limits
3. **Real-time Enrichment (60s+)**: Immediate backglog addition of event-driven enrichment for new qualifying senders (still ~10/sec during analysis)
4. **Post-Analysis Acceleration**: Increase to ~30 API calls/sec when main analysis completes
5. **Worker Processing**: Web worker fetches email bodies and extracts fresh links using priority-based parsing
6. **Data Return**: Worker sends enriched data back to main thread immediately
7. **Protected Storage**: Main thread updates IndexedDB with enriched URLs
8. **User Action**: Instant unsubscribe with fresh, working links

### Gmail API Rate Limiting Strategy

**User Quota**: 250 Gmail API units per second
**Main Analysis Usage**: ~230 units/second during active analysis
**Available for Enrichment**: ~10-20 units/second (takes 5 units per sender)

#### Rate Limiting Phases
- **During Analysis**: 2 API calls/second = 120 senders enriched per minute
- **Post-Analysis**: 30 API calls/second = 1,200 senders enriched per minute
- **Implementation**: 100ms delays during analysis, 50ms delays post-analysis

### File Structure & Separation of Concerns

```
src/
├── lib/
│   ├── gmail/
│   │   ├── fetchMetadata.ts       # Existing - headers/metadata only
│   │   ├── fetchFullMessage.ts    # NEW - complete message body for parsing
│   │   ├── linkParser.ts          # Standalone helper (Phase 0 - testable independently)
│   │   └── enrichmentUtils.ts     # Shared utilities
├── workers/
│   └── enrichmentWorker.ts        # Web worker (imports linkParser + fetchFullMessage)

│       └── ParserTester.tsx       # Phase 0 testing UI (uses fetchFullMessage)
└── app/
    └── test-parser/               # Testing page (removable after Phase 0)
        └── page.tsx
```

### Updated Data Structure (Append-Only Architecture)

```typescript
// Updated SenderResult interface
export interface SenderResult {
  senderEmail: string;
  senderName: string;
  count: number;
  unread_count: number;
  lastDate: string;
  analysisId: string;
  hasUnsubscribe: boolean;
  unsubscribe?: {
    // Original header data (can be overwritten freely during analysis)
    mailto?: string;
    url?: string;
    requiresPost?: boolean;
    
    // Enriched data (append-only, never overwritten)
    enrichedUrl?: string;        // NEW: Working HTTP link from email body
    enrichedAt?: number;         // NEW: When enrichment happened
    firstMessageId?: string;     // NEW: Message ID for enrichment (captured during analysis)
  };
  actionsTaken?: string[];
  messageIds?: string[];
  sampleSubjects?: string[];
}
```

### Analysis Merge Logic (Zero Performance Impact)

```typescript
// Append-only merge during batch processing
function mergeUnsubscribeData(existing, incoming, messageId) {
  const result = {
    // Always merge header data (existing logic unchanged)
    ...existing.unsubscribe,
    ...incoming.unsubscribe,
    
    // Preserve enriched data (never overwritten)
    enrichedUrl: existing.unsubscribe?.enrichedUrl,
    enrichedAt: existing.unsubscribe?.enrichedAt,
  };
  
  // Only set firstMessageId if we don't have one yet (captured during analysis)
  if (!existing.unsubscribe?.firstMessageId) {
    result.firstMessageId = messageId;
  } else {
    result.firstMessageId = existing.unsubscribe.firstMessageId;
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

### UI Fallback Logic (Clean Priority Chain)

```typescript
// Unsubscribe button logic - use best available option
function getUnsubscribeUrl(sender: SenderResult): string | null {
  const unsub = sender.unsubscribe;
  if (!unsub) return null;
  
  // Priority: enriched URL > header URL > header mailto
  return unsub.enrichedUrl || 
         unsub.url || 
         unsub.mailto || 
         null;
}
```

### Web Worker Communication Protocol
```typescript
// Messages sent TO worker
interface EnrichmentJob {
  id: string;
  senderEmail: string;
  messageId: string;
  accessToken: string;
  priority: number;
}

interface BatchEnrichmentJob {
  type: 'BATCH_ENRICH';
  senders: EnrichmentJob[];
  rateLimitPerSecond: 10; // Conservative during analysis
  accessToken: string;
  analysisComplete: boolean; // Switch to 20/sec when true
}

// Messages received FROM worker
interface EnrichmentResult {
  id: string;
  senderEmail: string;
  success: boolean;
  enrichedUrl?: string;        // Extracted HTTP unsubscribe URL
  confidence?: number;         // Parser confidence score (0-1)
  source?: string;            // Which parsing rule matched (e.g., "unsubscribe", "preferences")
  error?: string;
}
```

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Data Model Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Update data structures to support enrichment (no performance impact)

#### Data Model Updates (Append-Only Architecture)
- [ ] Extend `SenderResult.unsubscribe` interface with:
  - `enrichedUrl?: string` - working HTTP unsubscribe link from email body
  - `enrichedAt?: number` - timestamp of enrichment
  - `firstMessageId?: string` - message ID for enrichment (captured once per sender during analysis)
- [ ] Update IndexedDB schema version (increment DB_VERSION)
- [ ] Add migration logic for existing data (no changes needed - append-only)
- [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces across codebase

#### Analysis Flow Updates (Zero Performance Impact)
- [ ] Update sender merge logic to capture `firstMessageId` (only if not already set - happens during analysis)
- [ ] Preserve enriched fields during merge (don't overwrite enrichedUrl)
- [ ] Update `storeSenderResults` to handle new enriched fields
- [ ] **No conditional checks added** - append-only architecture eliminates performance overhead
- [ ] Test analysis performance - should be identical to current performance

### Phase 1: Parser Development (Week 2)
**Goal**: Build and thoroughly test the link parser in isolation

#### Standalone Parser Development
- [ ] Create `src/lib/gmail/fetchFullMessage.ts` helper for complete message fetching
- [ ] Create `src/lib/gmail/linkParser.ts` with priority-based link detection
- [ ] Implement the fallback chain (unsubscribe → preferences → opt-out → etc.)
- [ ] Add link validation and confidence scoring
- [ ] Handle edge cases (relative URLs, encoded links, malformed HTML)

#### Testing UI Development  
- [ ] Create dedicated testing page/modal (e.g., `/test-parser` or modal in dashboard)
- [ ] Add input field for Gmail message ID
- [ ] Integrate `fetchFullMessage` helper for complete email body retrieval
- [ ] Display raw email HTML content (formatted/readable)
- [ ] Show detected unsubscribe link with confidence score
- [ ] Add fallback chain visualization (which rules triggered)
- [ ] Include original List-Unsubscribe header for comparison

#### Parser Validation
- [ ] Test with various email types (marketing, transactional, newsletters)
- [ ] Validate against known good/bad unsubscribe links
- [ ] Fine-tune regex patterns and priority rules
- [ ] Document edge cases and limitations
- [ ] Establish parser accuracy baseline before full implementation

### Phase 2: On-Demand Enrichment (Week 3)
**Goal**: Implement on-demand enrichment when users click unsubscribe (efficient resource usage)

#### Smart Loading States
```typescript
// Unsubscribe button states
<button disabled={isEnriching}>
  {isEnriching ? 'Loading...' : 'Unsubscribe'}
</button>
```

#### On-Demand Enrichment Flow
```typescript
const handleUnsubscribe = async (sender: SenderResult) => {
  setIsEnriching(true);
  
  let bestUrl = null;
  
  // 1. Try enrichment if we have firstMessageId and no cached enriched URL
  if (sender.firstMessageId && !sender.unsubscribe?.enrichedUrl) {
    try {
      const enrichedUrl = await enrichSenderFromEmail(sender.firstMessageId);
      if (enrichedUrl) {
        bestUrl = enrichedUrl;
        // Cache result for future clicks
        await updateSenderWithEnrichedUrl(sender.email, enrichedUrl);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Enrichment failed, trying fallbacks:', error);
    }
  }
  
  // 2. Fallback to cached enriched URL
  if (!bestUrl && sender.unsubscribe?.enrichedUrl) {
    bestUrl = sender.unsubscribe.enrichedUrl;
  }
  
  // 3. Fallback to header URL
  if (!bestUrl && sender.unsubscribe?.url) {
    bestUrl = sender.unsubscribe.url;
  }
  
  // 4. Final fallback to mailto
  if (!bestUrl && sender.unsubscribe?.mailto) {
    bestUrl = `mailto:${sender.unsubscribe.mailto}`;
  }
  
  setIsEnriching(false);
  
  if (bestUrl) {
    window.open(bestUrl);
  } else {
    toast.error('No unsubscribe method available for this sender');
  }
};
```

## 🎉 Key Architectural Decisions Made

### ✅ Append-Only Architecture (Final Decision)
- **Eliminated**: `source` fields, `locked` fields, conditional merge checks, `enrichedMailto` (not needed)
- **Added**: `enrichedUrl` field that never gets overwritten  
- **Benefit**: Zero performance impact on analysis, eliminates merge conflicts
- **UI Logic**: Clean fallback chain `enrichedUrl || url || mailto`

### ✅ Protected firstMessageId Storage  
- **Captured during analysis**: `firstMessageId` set when processing messages, not by worker
- Only set `firstMessageId` if not already present (prevents overwrites)
- Each sender gets exactly one message ID for enrichment
- Simple conditional check only runs once per sender

### ✅ Web Worker for Processing  
- Dedicated worker prevents browser tab throttling
- True parallelism independent of analysis
- Rate limiting respects 10-20 units/sec quota constraints

**Last Updated**: December 2024
**Status**: Ready for Phase 0 Implementation  
**Architecture**: Append-Only (Performance Optimized) 

## Background & Strategy
- **Problem**: 90% of List-Unsubscribe header URLs are stale/broken
- **Solution**: Extract fresh unsubscribe links from email bodies (target: ~80% success rate)
- **Approach**: On-demand enrichment when users click unsubscribe (efficient resource usage)
- **Architecture**: Append-only data protection, no overwrites of enriched data

## Core Data Flow
1. **Analysis captures `firstMessageId`** (most recent email from each sender - Gmail API returns newest first!)
2. **On-demand enrichment** when user clicks unsubscribe button (300-600ms delay)
3. **Fallback chain**: `enrichedUrl` → `headerUrl` → `mailto` with loading states
